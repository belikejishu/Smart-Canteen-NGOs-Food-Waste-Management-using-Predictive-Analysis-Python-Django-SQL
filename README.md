Smart Canteen & NGOs: Food Waste Management Using Predictive Analysis
This project is a web-based application aimed at streamlining food ordering processes while addressing food waste management by connecting hotels/restaurants with NGOs to redistribute surplus food. Built using Python, Django, and MySQL, the system improves operational efficiency, reduces food wastage, and enhances user experience through predictive analysis and a dynamic recommendation system.
